This file is created to see how can we check if our local git repository is up to date and in sync with remote repo.


Steps to check local repository sync status with remote repository:

Run 'use git remote update' -> This command get the updated details of your remote refs.

Once you get the latest updates from remote repository, we can use below commands to do several things:

1] git status -uno:
will tell you whether the branch you are tracking is ahead, behind or has diverged.
If it says nothing, the local and remote are the same.

2] git show-branch *master :
will show you the commits in all of the branches whose names end in 'master' (eg master and origin/master).

If you use -v with git remote update (git remote -v update) you can see which branches got updated,
so you don't really need any further commands.
